# SortingAlgorithmVisualizer
This sorting visualizer is an interactive tool built using JavaScript, designed to visually demonstrate the process of various sorting algorithms in real time. It features intuitive controls, allowing users to select from multiple algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort. Users can dynamically adjust the array size with a slider, observe each step of the sorting process with animated transitions, and track algorithm performance visually. The tool includes color-coded bars to indicate the current state of the array, making it easy to understand how each algorithm operates on the data. It also allows users to stop and randomize the array during the sorting process, providing a flexible and engaging learning experience.
